## Library Management System 

## Overview

Developed a Library Management System using Python in Jupyter Notebook to simulate core library operations. This project focuses on applying fundamental programming concepts, data handling, and logical flow control in a practical use case.

 ## Key Highlights

* Designed and implemented core library functionalities using Python
* Applied conditional logic, loops, and data structures effectively
* Built a modular and easy-to-understand workflow suitable for beginners

## Features

* Add and manage book records
* Display available books
* Issue books and track borrowing
* Handle book returns


## Technologies & Tools

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook

## Project Structure

```
Library_Management_System.ipynb
```

## How to Run
. Open `Library_Management_System.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab
. Run the notebook cells sequentially

## Learning Outcomes

* Strengthened understanding of Python fundamentals
* Gained hands-on experience with problem-solving and logic building
* Practiced implementing real-world scenarios using code

## Future Improvements

* Integrate persistent storage (files or database)
* Add role-based user access
* Enhance usability with GUI or web-based interface
